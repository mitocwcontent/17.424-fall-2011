Course Overview
---------------

This graduate class is designed as a Ph.D.â€“level overview of international political economy (IPE), with an emphasis on the advanced industrial countries. It also serves as preparation for the IPE portion of the International Relations general exam. The course is divided into three sections: international trade; international monetary and financial relations (including foreign direct investment); and "other topics."

An important goal of the course is to use economic theories to identify the welfare effects, distributional consequences, and security implications of foreign economic policy decisions, and to use the tools of political science to analyze how interest groups, voters, political parties, electoral institutions, ideas, and power politics interact to shape policy outcomes. It is my hope that this course will generate ideas for your own research, leading to publishable papers and dissertation topics.

Prerequisites
